# Typing_Speed

## Description

Currently, typing_speed.c compiles into a command line game that counts how many characters you can type in 10 seconds. Next update will include a variable time limit.

## How to use

Compile using gcc:
'''
$ gcc typing_speed.c -lpthread -lm
'''

OR use the provided Makefile:
'''
$ make
'''

At execution the program will listen for keystrokes for 10 seconds and then tell you how good of a typer you are!

Enjoy!
